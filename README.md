FailFast
========

A tiny library to help developers build fail-fast systems.


The Principle
=============

The fail-fast principle is a system design principle. 

Such a system is designed to make immediately error response when it is used wrong.

The goal of such a behaviour is to remove magical/complex/fault-tolerant code aka "expensive" code.

If this either makes no sense to you, or you just is not convinced, please visit:

 1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast - an introduction with references
 
 2) http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf - this turned stubborn me around
 

Target Audience
===============

Object-Oriented software developers using Java (... and maybe other languages e.g. C# in the future).


Goal
====

To have a library worth using because of its 

 1) design - simple, extensible & replaceable, and
 
 2) performance - poor on cpu & memory usage.
 
We migrate between projects and we ask ourself what libraries should we pull this time? 
In such moments I try a search for a fail-fast library, but I can't seem to find any.

Clearly, that is no good to anyone, so here is one.

State
========

The 1st major version of this library will only support a construct with a check & fail-pair (see http://starkcoder.blogspot.dk/2013/06/how-could-failfast-library-work.html).

If you think the check & fail-pair construct is odd, you might want to checkout the spot contractor pattern (http://yoawsconsult.blogspot.dk/2012/11/spot-contractor-software-pattern.html). The pattern enforces correctness and performance.

Confidence in the current design is getting high now, though it still needs some tests to prove that
the check & fail-methods can be "managed" from another jar e.g. replaced and/or extended. Inheritance should take care of most, but it is unknown whether the failer-annotations can be modified e.g. to change failer-output formatting.

The scope of the 1st major version is check & fail-pairs that can handle objects wrapping primitives and a few basic object types from the standard library. Since each type seems to require around 10(+/-4) method pairs (see wiki link below), it takes a while to get the implementation complete. The 8 primitives are byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. Implementation is first done via the primitives' wrapping Objects (Byte, Short, etc.). Later on the primitives might be directly implemented to avoid boxing performance penalties. Additional Object types are Object, String, Enum and UUID. In total this gives a list of at least 20 types to support, so with the 6 types currently supported the library implementation is about 30% complete.

Builds, Tests & Jar
===================

(To Be Defined)


Dogma
=====

I try to follow these Object-oriented design principles:

A) Importance: Code > Tests > Examples > Documentation.

B) The library may only have 1 static entry, if really needed.

C) Specification Design using Interfaces. Implementation calls Interfaces.

D) Implementation Design using Abstract Classes. Implementation is replaceable/extensible.

D) Strong Encapsulation. Fields are private, implementation only adds protected methods.

E) Fail-fast principle using runtime exceptions.

F) Favor simple runtime features over fancy runtime features. Keeps it straight-forward.  

I change my opinions often. Sometimes because I improve, sometimes because I get a wrong idea.

Please help me change my opinions and this library.


Kind Regards,

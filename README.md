FailFast
========

A tiny library to help developers build fail-fast systems.


Target Audience
===============

Object-Oriented software developers using Java (... and maybe other languages e.g. C# in the future).


The Principle
=============

The fail-fast principle is a system design principle. 

Such a system is designed to make immediately error response when it is used wrong.

The goal of such a behaviour is to remove magical/complex/fault-tolerant code aka "expensive" code.

If this either makes no sense to you, or you just is not convinced, please visit:

 1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast - an introduction with references
 
 2) http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf - this turned stubborn me around


The Practice
=============

As a developer you add throw sections in your code. Some of these are simple e.g. check an argument and throw an exception, if it is illegal. These standard sections are what this library tries to help you with. 

So why do you need help for that?

Your sections might be generalized into 

			if(CONDITIONAL) 
			{ 
				throw EXCEPTION(MESSAGE);
			}  

'CONDITIONAL' is code that this library encapsulates. This reduces duplicated code in your application and should make it easier for you to avoid errors.

The 'if(CONDITIONAL)' should always result in a throw part, so when using this library a contract is started. The contract is ended with a 2nd call to the library that encapsulates 'throw EXCEPTION(MESSAGE);'. This also removes duplicated code in your application and increases consistency.

With this library the above section is turned into

			if(checker.isCONDITIONAL(CHECKER_USER_ARGUMENTS)) 
			{ 
				// call contract customizations can go here e.g. change EXCEPTION or MESSAGE format
				failer.failCONDITIONAL(FAILER_USER_ARGUMENTS));
			}  

Note! Sometimes this section is collapsed into a single function call. This is NOT an optimal solution, since the 1 call encapsulates the control point and therefore requires all information as arguments; even if the CONDITIONAL is false. The result is 1 expensive one-liner without much room for customizations.

With this library your code still owns the control point. 

So how does this look like? The library offers many checker-failer pairs e.g.

			if(checker.isObjectNull(this, referenceNull))
			{
				failer.failObjectNull(this, "referenceNull");
			}

The arguments are the dynamic information that changes. 'this' is an Object that is to identify the caller of the checker-failer methods. In the checker-call a contract with the caller is started, if 'referenceNull' is in-fact null, otherwise no contract is started. 'this' is therefore needed again as an argument in the failer-call - to end the engaged contract. 'referenceNull' is an argument for the checker call and as an identification argument in the failer call. 

If the checker-call returns false, no contract has been started and the failer method will - and should not - be called. This is the cheap outcome, where no new instances are needed.

If the checker-call asserts, a contract is started and ended by the expensive failer-call. The failer-call throws a FailFastException with message "ObjectNullTest.testObjectNullFailNoMessage: Object 'referenceNull' is null. " (see https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/wiki/isObjectNull-&-failObjectNull).
Each checker-failer pair is associated with an exception type, a message format and a message arguments mapping. The ObjectNull checker-failer pair is by default set to exception type FailFastException, message format "%s: Object '%s' is null." and arguments mapping "fu0, fu1" (meaning the 2 failer user arguments).

Is this enough for you? Well, I don't know. Let's figure that one out together. Any feedback is appreciated.

Some of your questions might be answered in the FAQ below, otherwise please create an issue.
 
 
FAQ
===
 - Is the library free? Yes.
 - Is the library open source? Yes.
 - Is the library threadsafe? Yes.
 - How do I get started? Download a jar, put in the classpath either use the library directly (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/wiki/Setup-&-Shutdown) or wrap it yourself (see Can I extend and customize it?).
 - Can I extend and customize it? Yes. No wiki yet, but have a look at the code examples (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/Examples/src/starkcoder/failfast/examples/reference2failfast/myfailfast).
 - Which types are supported? Please refer to the wiki (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/wiki).
 - Can I customize exceptions thrown? Yes (Since 1.2) in 3 ways. Dynamically per checker-failer-call by customizing the call contract: See section 'Contract Customization' in (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/blob/master/Java/UnitTests/src/starkcoder/failfast/unit/objects/ObjectNullTest.java). Dynamically e.g. at application start by customizing the Failer instance: See section 'Failer Customizations' in (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/blob/master/Java/UnitTests/src/starkcoder/failfast/unit/objects/ObjectNullTest.java). Statically by overriding specifications via inheritance (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/Examples/src/starkcoder/failfast/examples/reference2failfast/myfailfast/withoverrides).
 - Can I check if a failfast exception has been thrown? Yes (https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/Examples/src/starkcoder/failfast/examples/exceptionhandling).


Examples
========

The wiki has a lot of test examples that hopefully makes sense to you:
 - https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/wiki

The wiki is really a handedited proxy for 2 test packages:
 - https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/Examples/src/starkcoder/failfast/examples
 - https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/UnitTests/src/starkcoder/failfast/unit/objects

Continuous Integration
======================

Every new commit triggers a build and unit test run on Travis CI: 
 - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KeldOelykke/FailFast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KeldOelykke/FailFast)

Releases
===================

Go to http://oelykke-failfast.appspot.com to:
 - download jars
 - view api (javadoc)
 - view unit test results (junit)
 - try the checker-failer pairs online
 
Alternatively, jars can be downloaded from GitHub:
 - https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/releases
 - https://github.com/KeldOelykke/FailFast/tree/master/Java/Web/war/releases

Goal
====

To have a library worth using because of its 

 1) design - simple, extensible & replaceable, and
 
 2) performance - poor on cpu & memory usage.
 
We migrate between projects and we ask ourself what libraries should we pull this time? 
In such moments I try a search for a fail-fast library, but I can't seem to find any.

Clearly, that is no good to anyone, so here is one.

State
========

The 1st major version of this library will only support a construct with a check & fail-pair (see http://starkcoder.blogspot.dk/2013/06/how-could-failfast-library-work.html).

If you think the check & fail-pair construct is odd, you might want to checkout the spot contractor pattern (http://yoawsconsult.blogspot.dk/2012/11/spot-contractor-software-pattern.html). The pattern enforces correctness and performance.

Confidence in the current design is getting high now, though it still needs some tests to prove that
the check & fail-methods can be "managed" from another jar e.g. replaced and/or extended. Inheritance should take care of most, but it is unknown whether the failer-annotations can be modified e.g. to change failer-output formatting.

The scope of the 1st major version is check & fail-pairs that can handle objects wrapping primitives and a few basic object types from the standard library. The 8 primitives are byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. Implementation is first done via the primitives' wrapping Objects (Byte, Short, etc.). Later on the primitives might be directly implemented to avoid boxing performance penalties. Additional Object types are Object, String, Enum, UUID and Date. 

It seems to me that some runtime customization options could be very useful (and much easier than inheritance), so version 1.2 focuses on this functionality. 

The scope of the 2nd major version is check & fail-pairs that can handle arrays and collection of above mentioned types. Furthermore, more types and check & fail-pairs might be added.

Dogma
=====

I try to follow these Object-oriented design principles:

A) Importance: Code > Tests > Examples > Documentation.

B) The library may only have 1 static entry, if really needed.

C) Specification Design using Interfaces. Implementation calls Interfaces.

D) Implementation Design using Abstract Classes. Implementation is replaceable/extensible.

D) Strong Encapsulation. Fields are private, implementation only adds protected methods.

E) Fail-fast principle using runtime exceptions.

F) Favor simple runtime features over fancy runtime features. Keeps it straight-forward.  

I change my opinions often. Sometimes because I improve, sometimes because I get a wrong idea.

Please help me change my opinions and this library.


Kind Regards,

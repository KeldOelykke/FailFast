/**
 * Specifies an equals check for float allowing some difference e.g. due to calculation errors.
 * <p>
 * This is an attempt on a better equals check than the traditional epsilon test
 * (doesn't support both tiny and huge numbers for 1 particular epsilon value).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is also an attempt on a better equals check than the relative error test
 * (doesn't support tiny numbers without an absolute epsilon test).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The goal is to get rid of both the absolute and relative epsilon values by using accuracy 
 * of the mantissa aka number of significant digits we include in the check.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The idea is to find the greatest exponent X of A and B, 
 * calculate the mantissa difference between A and B (with exponent X) 
 * and look how big that is in comparison to the mantissa of a specified accuracy (with exponent X).

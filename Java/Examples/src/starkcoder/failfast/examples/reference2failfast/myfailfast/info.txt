package starkcoder.failfast.examples.reference2failfast.myfailfast is an
example on how you can wrap the failfast library, so you can extend or replace
the code when needed.

Most example files are basically wrappers for you to reference:
- IMyFailFast & MyFailFast (yours) that wrap IFailFast & FailFast (failfast api)
- IMyChecker & MyChecker (yours) that wrap IChecker & Checker (failfast api), and 
- IMyFailer & MyFailer (yours) that wrap IFailer & Failer (failfast api).

Additionally, a static class - SMyFailFast - can be used to manage a single set of failfast instances.

package starkcoder.failfast.examples.reference2failfast.myfailfast.withoverrides is an
example on how you can wrap the failfast library and replace
code when needed.

Most example files are basically wrappers for you to reference:
- IMyFailFast & MyFailFast (yours) that wrap IFailFast & FailFast (failfast api)
- IMyChecker & MyChecker (yours) that wrap IChecker & Checker (failfast api),  
- IMyFailer & MyFailer (yours) that wrap IFailer & Failer (failfast api), and
- IMyObjectNullCheck & IMyObjectNullFail (yours) being a customized checker-failer pair.

Additionally, a static class - SMyFailFast - can be used to manage a single set of failfast instances.
